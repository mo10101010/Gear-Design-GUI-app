# Gear Design GUI app
App used to design a 2 spur gear, from main properties to materials
## Main Components
THe app is built upon matlab using App Designer, with 6 GUIs:
1. GearDesignApp.mlapp --> Main GUI
2. ModuleApp.mlapp 
3. PlotGears.mlapp
4. GearAboutusApp.mlapp
5. GearCallusApp.mlapp
6. Questionapp.mlapp

## How it works
The GearDesignApp.mlapp is divided into 2 sections:
1. Inputs section --> 6 inputs
2. Outputs section --> 18 outputs

Steps:
1. The user enters the main gear data then adds input section 
2. The user then presses solve
3. A window of Module Table appeaer
4. The user then enters module and diameter, then presses ok
5. Then the user clicks to solve
6. The results appear in the output section

Auxilliary Section:
1. PlotGears GUI
   - USed to display main dimensionsal properties of pinion and gear
   - Adds a gear plot for reference, just a photo
2. AboutUS GUI
   - tells the users abou the contributers
3. GearCallusApp GUI
   - How to connect to the contributers
4. Questionapp GUI
   - What is this app actually doing

## Further development
We have added featuers that maybe could have done better:
The module app could have been excluded, using image processing feature to extract data, Actully there was efforts to convert that curves into fuctions. This effort was done but actually it didn't work as well. <p>
The gear could be actually plotted, may be simulated which will enhance the user's experience. <p>

## Issues
For sure there is no perfect thing, this is real iife
The issue is I lost the final edited edition of this app this doesn't mean what I uploaded is null, but need refining for bugs and errors
